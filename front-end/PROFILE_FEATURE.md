# Profile Management Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive profile management functionality allowing logged-in users to view and edit their profile information, including profile picture upload.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Profile Settings Page** (`Settings.jsx`)
- ✅ New "Profile" section as the first tab in Settings
- ✅ Display and edit user's full name
- ✅ Display and edit user's email
- ✅ Profile image upload with preview
- ✅ Change password functionality (current password + new password)
- ✅ Form validation for password changes
- ✅ Success/error message notifications
- ✅ Loading states during save operations
- ✅ Image size validation (max 5MB)
- ✅ Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF

### 2. **Sidebar Profile Display** (`SideBar.jsx`)
- ✅ Shows profile image if uploaded
- ✅ Falls back to gradient avatar with initials if no image
- ✅ Profile image displayed at top of sidebar
- ✅ Circular image with ring border for better visibility
- ✅ Responsive design (works in collapsed and expanded modes)

### 3. **API Service** (`api.js`)
Added new endpoints:
- `updateProfile(profileData)` - Update user profile information
- `uploadProfileImage(imageFile)` - Upload profile picture
- Both functions support FormData for file uploads

### 4. **Auth Context** (`AuthContext.jsx`)
Enhanced context with:
- `updateUser(userData)` - Method to update user data in context and localStorage
- Profile image stored in localStorage as `userProfileImage`
- Automatic sync between context state and localStorage
- Profile image cleared on logout

## How It Works

### Profile Update Flow
1. User navigates to Settings → Profile tab
2. User edits name, email, or uploads profile image
3. Optionally changes password (requires current password)
4. Clicks "Save Changes" button
5. Data sent to backend API via `api.updateProfile()`
6. On success:
   - User context updated with new data
   - Profile image shown in sidebar immediately
   - Success message displayed
   - Password fields cleared
7. On error:
   - Error message displayed with details

### Profile Image Upload
1. User clicks "Choose Image" button
2. File picker opens (accepts image/* files)
3. Image validated (max 5MB)
4. Preview shown immediately (base64 data URL)
5. Image sent as FormData on form submit
6. Backend returns image URL
7. URL stored in localStorage and shown in sidebar

## API Integration

### Update Profile Endpoint
```javascript
PUT /api/auth/profile
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
- name: string
- email: string
- currentPassword: string (optional, required for password change)
- newPassword: string (optional)
- profileImage: File (optional)
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "email": "updated@email.com",
    "profileImage": "https://backend.com/uploads/profile-123.jpg",
    "role": "user"
  },
  "message": "Profile updated successfully"
}
```
